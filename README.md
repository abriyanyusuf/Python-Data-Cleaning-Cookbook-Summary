# Python-Data-Cleaning-Cookbook-Summary
This repository contains exercise files that I created myself in Google Colab by following guidelines sourced from a book called Python Data Cleaning Cookbook written by Michael Walker and published by Packt Publishing Ltd in 2020. The files related to the exercises I did were obtained through the GitHub Repository from the book.
